Some classes presented in the sequence diagrams may have different names than the ones in the Project, but
serve simular purpose. Such examples are "DisplayControl" in the diagram and "GUI" in the project, and
"DisplaySettings" in the diagram and "EventHandler" in the project. The reason for the difference in names is
because the sequence diagram and the coding of the project were done at the same time, and while each had simular ideas,
the titles given to the concepts differed slightly.

Along with name differences, some functions shown in the sequence diagram may not appear in the project. One such function would
be changeColorPattern(). The reason for the absence of some functions is either they were deemed redudant by another function, or
implimentation was cut back due to time constraints.
